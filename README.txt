In here you will find the BASIC program for a drawing used on
http://reddit.com/r/RetroBattlestations. The program was intended to
be reusable and reasonably portable to many different BASIC
flavors. The graphics have been encoded in a vector format and are
scaled to the screen size. Routines for drawing lines and elliptical
arcs have been put into small subroutines.

=== Typing Tips ===
When typing the program in you can leave off any lines which contain
REM, they are not needed for the program to run. You can also leave
out all whitespace*. Most BASIC dialects also allow the use of ? as a
substitute for PRINT to reduce the amount of typing.

* On the TRS-80 Color Computer you need a space before THEN
